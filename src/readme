SensorCenter:
    To be called from the Terminal with
        python SensorCenter.py [RunTime] [Frequency] -t

        The -t signals this is a test run and uses a double array of integers for testing output.

        In near future -t will be optional. For now, the -t is necessary otherwise it calls the
        start() function which  produces no output.
